# ATM-console-project
The ATM Console Project in C# is a console-based application designed to simulate basic ATM functionalities. The project aims to provide users with an interactive interface where they can perform common banking operations such as checking balances, withdrawing funds, and validating ATM card numbers.
This project is an excellent opportunity for developers to understand and implement core concepts of C# programming, including object-oriented programming, data validation, and user input handling.
